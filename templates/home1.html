          <p>This project aims to develop a rainfall prediction system that utilizes image processing techniques to analyze relevant 
            images and machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall events. We will preprocess satellite imagery to enhance key 
            features and use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify patterns associated with rainfall. By combining these 
            insights with historical weather data, our model aims to improve prediction accuracy.<br>
            Ultimately, this project seeks to create a reliable and accessible tool for predicting rainfall, which can significantly 
            benefit various sectors and help communities better prepare for changing weather conditions. Through this innovative 
            approach, we hope to contribute to more effective weather forecasting and improved decision-making in response to rainfall events.

                The "Rainfall Prediction using Image Processing and Machine Learning" project aims to enhance the accuracy of weather 
                forecasting by utilizing modern technology. This initiative focuses on analyzing satellite images and weather visuals 
                to predict rainfall events more effectively. The project begins with the collection and preprocessing of satellite images, 
                where important features such as cloud patterns and moisture levels are extracted. This preprocessing step enhances the 
                visual data, making it easier to identify signs of impending rain.<br>
                Next, we employ advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to train our 
                model in recognizing patterns associated with rainfall. By learning from historical data and images, the model gains 
                the ability to make informed predictions about future rainfall events. To further improve accuracy, the project 
                integrates insights from image analysis with historical weather data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding 
                of prevailing weather conditions.
